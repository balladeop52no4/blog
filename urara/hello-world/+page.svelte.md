So most of the times, <br>
I would say I'm a pretty bright-spirited person, uh<br>
Easy to get along with, you know?<br>
And most of the times, I do smile a lot, I reckon<br>

Fuck'n hell.<br>

## ABOUT THIS BLOG
Everything I write here, you can view as a beginner's notes of self-observation. And my observations on these matters, the thoughts and actions taken from these observations, as well as the resulting outcomes - that is, the way you see me in daily life, if we are fortunate enough to meet in personal - all of these will be recorded.

## ABOUT ME

Voyager, Puzzle-addictator, Fast-leaner<br>
And Billionaire - a title I've had my sights set on for the next 20 years.<br>
However, regardless of how others perceive me, my personal favorite one is<br>

_A good soldier._
